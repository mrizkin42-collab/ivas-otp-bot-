# Telegram OTP Monitor (Playwright + Python)

This repository contains a production-ready Telegram bot that logs into a virtual-number website (like `ivas.com`), monitors the user's message inbox for OTPs, and forwards them to your Telegram chat ‚Äî without an official API (uses headless browser automation).

> **Important:** You must have permission from the website owner to automate/scrape their site. Use responsibly.

---

## Features
- Uses **Playwright** (headless) for robust login & scraping.
- Sends status updates to Telegram for:
  - Bot started
  - Login success / failure
  - New OTP received
  - Errors & restarts
- Keeps track of last-sent message to avoid duplicates (persisted to `last_seen.json`).
- Designed to be deployed on platforms such as Render / Docker / GitHub Actions (see notes).

---
